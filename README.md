## 1. Solution Overview

![alt text](images/asesequencevsdx.png "Template Deployment Sequence")

This Blueprint deploys a fully automated secure baseline Azure ARM Template + PowerShell solution to provision a highly secure, orchestrated and configured Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment mapped to a NIST 800-66 assurance security controls matrix, that includes :

+ Azure App Service Environment v2 (ASE v2) with an Internal Load Balancer (ILB)
+ Azure Web App within ASE
+ Redis Cache Cluster
+ Azure Virtual Network
+ Azure Network Security Groups
+ Web Application Gateway with WAF in Prevention Mode
+ Azure SQL 
+ Azure KeyVault
+ Azure Active Directory

The environment is locked down using Network Security Groups on each subnet with restricted access between all provisioned Azure services and also between subnets, as described in the [security](#23-security) section below.

### 1.1 NIST 800-66 Based Assurance Framework for Azure PaaS Blueprint

## 3.0 NIST 800-66 Assurance Security Compliance Matrix

You can also view the security controls matrix (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet), which maps the architecture decisions, components, and configuration in this Quick Start to security requirements within NIST, TIC, and DoD Cloud SRG publications; indicates which Azure ARM templates and PowerShell scripts affect the controls implementation; and specifies the associated Azure resources within the templates. The excerpt in Figure 1 provides a sample of the available information.

>The NIST 800-66 Security Controls Matrix for this blueprint can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/mayurshintre/Blueprints-PaaS-ASE/tree/master/ase-ilb-blueprint/images/nist80066matrix.xlsx).

## 4. Deployment Guide

### 4.1 Installation Prerequisites

This solution utilizes a combination of ARM templates and PowerShell. In order to deploy the solution, you must have the following packages installed correctly and in working order on your local machine

+ [Install and configure](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) the latest version of PowerShell
+ [Install and configure](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn975125.aspx#Anchor_5) Azure Active Directory V2 PowerShell Module
+ [Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps?) Azure Resource Manager PowerShell Module

### 4.2 Deployment Steps Overview
> **Please Note**: At this time, the entire blueprint cannot be deployed only using the ARM template (azuredeploy.json). The solution must be deployed by executing the AzureDeploy.ps1 locally. 

1. Clone the solution on your local machine
2. Navigate to _azuredeploy.parameters.json_ on your local machine and fill in all parameter values for your deployment as defined in the [Configure _azuredeploy.parameters.json_](#45-configure-azuredeploy.parameters.json) section
3. Update the User Defined values in the AzureDeploy.ps1
4. Execute AzureDeploy.ps1
5. Grab a coffee and wait for deployment to finish. Deployment time can take anywhere between 1-2 hours.

### 4.3 Template Deployment Sequence

git clone https://github.com/mayurshintre/Blueprints-PaaS-ASE.git somefolder
``` 
+ or download as a ZIP from https://github.com/mayurshintre/Blueprints-PaaS-ASE

### 4.5 Configure _azuredeploy.parameters.json_

>This is the **main** configuration file. 

Navigate to the _ase-ilb-blueprint/_ folder file on your local machine and update the default parameters the _azuredeploy.parameters.json_. This file holds all configuration and sizing parameters for all services deployed in this Blueprint. Please follow the instructions carefully as any typo's can result in a failed deployment. Notes for configuration values can be found in this file and also searched in relevant [Azure Quickstart Templates in Github](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates)

### 4.6 Configure _azuredeploy.ps1_ PowerShell File

Set the environment variables user defined inputs section in the _azuredeploy.ps1_ file

``` PowerShell
##Azure Region to Deploy all resources including the Resource Group
$Region = "West US"

##Name of the Resource Group to deploy
$RgName = "demo"
	
##Name to give the Deployment that will be ran
$DeploymentName = $RgName +"nist800ase"

##Location of the main azuredeploy.json template
$TemplateUri = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mayurshintre/Blueprints/master/ase-ilb-blueprint/azuredeploy.json"

##Location of the local parameters file
$ParameterFile = "your_local_repository_location\azureDeploy.parameters.json"
    
##Subscription ID that will be used to host the resource group
$SubscriptionID = "Your Subscription ID here"
```
### 4.7 Run _azuredeploy.ps1_

```

### 4.9 Optional - Post Deployment ExpressRoute UDR

If you plan to terminate a VPN connection or On-premises ExpressRoute to this ASE Vnet **and turn on forced tunnelling**, you will require all the subnets to have User Defined Routes to traverse all internet facing traffic direcly out of the Vnet. This is required for proper functioning of the ASE environments as specified in the [ASE ExpressRoute network requirements article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-app-service-environment-network-configuration-expressroute#enabling-outbound-network-connectivity-for-an-app-service-environment)

The UDR.ps1 script can be run after a successful deployment to apply these default UDR's to all subnets to bypass forced tunneling to on-premises network.

You will require to fill in the following values inside the UDR.ps1 powershell.

``` PowerShell
## Resource Group Name of the deployed Blueprint environment
$ResourceGroup = "RG Name Here"
## Location of the Resource Group of the deployed Blueprint environment
$location = "Location Here"
## Name of the User Defined Route. Can be left at default.
$UDRName = "ASEInternetOutbound"
## Name of the VNET in which the Bluepring ASE is deployed
$ExistingVnetName = "VNet name here"
## Do not rename this variable.
$routeName = "RouteToInternet"
```

## 5. Modifying the Templates

You can modify the ARM templates directly by following the ARM json syntax. By and large, there should be no need to modify the ARM templates except for the _azuredeploy.parameters.json_

In some cases you may wish to modify values hardcoded as variables in _azuredeploy.json_ or individual resource templates under the _/templates_ folder, not exposed as parameters in the _azuredeploy.parameters.json_ template by design. 

+ For example, if you need to change the Redis Cache configuration to enable non-SSL ports, you can navigate to the azuredelploy.json template and modify the following parameters in the json code block below 
``` json
    "enableNonSSLPort": false,
    "redisCachemaxclients": 7500,
    "redisCachemaxmemoryreserved": 200,
    "redisCachemaxfragmentationmemory-reserved": 300,
    "redisCachemaxmemory-delta": 200,
```
_Excerpt from azuredeploy.json for hard-coded redis cache variables not exposed in azuredeploy.parameters.json file_

+ Some values are intentionally hardcoded as variables in _azuredeploy.json_ in order to prevent the end user from modifying those values, to meet the NIST 800-66 security controls, and in other cases, such as the redis cache _max_ values, because they are widely accepted as defaults and do not need end user configuration.

>**Please Note: By changing any security related hard-coded variables in _azuredeploy.json_ or any other individual resource teplates, you will break the NIST 800-66 secure baseline compliance assurance provided in the [NIST 800-66 Security Compliance Matrix](#nist-800-66-security-compliance-matrix) section and the obligation to meet and map any unmet security controls will be transferred on to you, the end user.**

## 6. Cost

You are entirely responsible for the cost of the Azure services used while running this NIST 800-66 reference PaaS deployment template for ASEv2. There is no additional cost for using this template. The Azure Resource Manager template for this NIST 800-66 reference PaaS deployment for ASE includes configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings will affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each Azure service you will be using, the [Azure Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/), or the [Azure Channel Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) if you are an enterprise customer with an ELA. Prices are subject to change.
